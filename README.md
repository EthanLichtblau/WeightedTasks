# WeightedTasks
When trying to self study various domains and manage other productive habits, I thought it was quite overwhelming at times. Additionally, I wanted to optimize the amount of time I spend on each category of interest based on my personal opionion of its' importance or how much I enjoy doing it. This program is intended to help solve this issue.

In this GUI program, users can input a category of interest and an associated weight (scale 1-5) signifying importance. Refreshing the selection will trigger a random selection of different categories with higher weighted categories appearing more often. You can indicate when you've worked on a perticular task and the number of completions is stored in the JSON file along with the categories name, weight, and whether the task is ongoing or marked as complete (for tasks not reoccuring).
